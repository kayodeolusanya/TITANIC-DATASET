# TITANIC-DATASET
Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the
White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic
Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg
during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK,
to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers
and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made
the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single
ship up to that time.[a] It remains to this day the
deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise
ship.[4] The disaster drew much public attention,
provided foundational material for the disaster film
genre, and has inspired many artistic works.
